The chapter is focused on storing and collaborating on code using git and Github for version control.

## Intro

Git is known as a "version control" tool, which is used for tracking and managing changes to code over time between multiple developers. This allows teams to view changes to their code over time as well as "rollback" to previous code if needed. It also allows for remote storage of code to keep code safe and allow for collaboration between users.

## What is git?

Git is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It does this through "commits" which developers make as save points. In the diagram above, each point is a commit. Multiple versions of code can be stored in "branches". In the diagram above branches are the black lines splitting off and joining back together. This allows changes to be made safely in a separate area from the original code before being "merged" back into the main branch.

This gives developers a safe way to make changes and test without overwriting their original code.

## What is Github?

Github is an online platform for hosting and storing Git repositories, as well as managing teams and groups. This means your code isn't only stored in one place and can be retrieved by anyone with access on any machine. Github also provides a methods to review code, its history, and merge changes together through "Pull Requests."

## Getting Started Guides

The easiest way to get started with Git and Github is to use Github Desktop or the Source Control feature of VSCode. VSCode is recommended if that is the code editor you're using.

## Essential Concepts

### Repo - the folder your project is stored in

### Commit - a point in time save
